# restaurant-review
Currently on the second phase of the machine project in CCPAPDEV. This is a restaurant review website with users and logging in. The back-end has been implemented using MongoDB. Cloudinary is used as the cloud service where images are stored. Many features are implemented such as creating reviews, editing reviews, registering, tagging reviews as helpful, searching and editing your settings.

The web application should be run using node.js. After installing node.js, install all necessary modules with 'npm install'. Run with 'node app.js'.

For sample users to test out features:
    {"email": "kenbarbie@gmail.com",
    "password": "ken123"}
    {"email": "carson@gmail.com",
    "password": "carsoncarson"}
    {"email": "barbieken@gmail.com",
    "password": "barbie123"}
