# restaurant-review
Currently on the first phase of the machine project in CCPAPDEV. This is a restaurant review website with users and logging in. So far only front-end built, no back-end features have been fully implemented although some javascript was used to simulate some features. The entire project was built in Vanilla Javascript, with HTML and CSS, with no frameworks.

The website should be started at index.html, and an internet connection is required to load certain icons. VSCode's Live Server is where it displays best.
